# TOP Javascript Course Project - Shopping Cart

04/26/2022 ~ 05/17/2022

## Objectives

Using routing and testing in react.js, create a simple multi-page site with shopping cart function.

Your site should including the following:

- At least two pages to navigate between
- Allow users to add items to their cart
- Shopping cart should update pricing if item amount changes

## Learnings

Still getting a feel for how to code in React. Encountered the leading zero bug that happens inside of controlled inputs. I would like to loop back to this project at a later time to fix bugs, redo the site design, and polish.
